Extension Options
-----------------

### See No Evil ###
This mode replaces all images in posts tagged as "Arduino Hacks" with images of serious buisness people doing serious things. Becuase _you_ are serious, super serious about not wanting to see Arduinos.

### Hear No Evil ###
Arduino, arduino, _arduino_, __arduino__. Does just the word itself leave your fingers itching to lay down a scathing comment slamming the obviously noob hackers pathetic attempt at whatever the hell thing they just created? Well back away from the comments section because this mode is for you. Replace the word Arduino with one of your choosing. Recommended options include:

* "noob-board"
* "doo-hicky"
* "thing-a-ma-bob"
* "physical-manifestation-of-my-own-deep-seated-insecurity"

### Speak No Evil ###
If non of the other options are enough and you're still feeling a desperate urge to unleash a torrent of anti-Arduino bile in the comments sections, this is the nuclear option. It simply and elegantly removes any post from Hack-A-Day tagged "Arduino Hacks"
